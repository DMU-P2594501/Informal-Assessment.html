    <!-- Intro into Liams life and musical career -->
  
<p>William John Paul Gallagher was born on the 21st September 1972 and is known for being the lead singer in the band Oasis (1991-2009). William is most known as Liam and was/is also nicknamed Our Kid by his brother Noel Gallagher and the fans. Liam formed Oasis with three friends before asking his brother to join them. In 1994, the band released their debut album Definitely Maybe which became an immediate commercial and critical success. With over 8 million copies sold worldwide.
   With the overwhelming success and popularity, Liam and the rest of the band were gaining a representation of having an outspoken and abrasive behaviour. Liam being the main focus when clashing with he media and his "hooligan manner" during nights out and day drinking and consumption of drugs. After releasing 8 albums and 2 additional compliation albums; becoming a global phenomonan and cementing their way into British music culture, the band broke up. This was due to an ongoing dispute between the two Gallagher brothers. While Noel found sucess in his solo career (Noel Gallaghers High Flying Birds), Liam went down a darker path as he was in denial with the split of Oasis. This led to a less succesful band called Beady Eye. As he dived deeper into depression and sorrow, the reception of his new music got less and less support and credit. </p>
