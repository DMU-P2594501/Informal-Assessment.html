<p>After the Oasis split, Liam went into a phase of denial, he was depressed and dove deep into alcohol. This therefore left his music career in the gutter as his band at the time (Beady Eye) wasn't very succesful. The band eventually split in 2014 which left people thinking that the good days were behind the singer and that he won't ever return.</P>

<P>This was until he was recorded in a pub with the locals singing a new song (Bold) on a guitar. The clip went viral as Oasis fans (new and old) hyped up the return of the rock 'n' roll star. This turned out to be a big reason for Liams return as the sudden buzz motivated him to make more music and therefore his solo album. In 2017, As You Were was released and one of the biggest comebacks in Rock 'n' Roll was complete. Since then he has released a second solo album (Why Me? Why Not!) and has arguably outshined Noel. One reason for why fans have grown to respect and love Liam more than Noel in recent years, is the dedication to the fans themselves. One memborable gesture by Liam that won't ever be forgotten by fans is the sudden appearance at One Love Manchester after the terrorist attack in 2017. He postponed his performance in Germany and flew over to perform infront of his home crowd, singing Live Forever at the end of his performance in honor of those who'd lost their lives and were affected by the attack.</p>
